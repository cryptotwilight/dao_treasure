Safe transparency in Treasury. It is a difficult topic in DAOs or for any Web3 project. The goal of this project is to develop a Web3 treasury management system with a dashboard that enables DAOs to be open about where they make investments and how well their investments perform. The idea is to begin a public good that encourages better governance, 
and sound risk taking within DAOs using transparently acquired Covalent data.
